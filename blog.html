            <p>Okay so I found this cool problem:</p>
            <img src="./markov_1.jpg"" alt="blackrock question" style="width: 400px; height:auto"/>
            <p>Here is how I solved it:</p>
            <p>
                This is a classic markov chain problem where we have to find the state probabilities of the system. I mapped out the transition matrix as the following:
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <th>State 1</th>
                    <th>State 2</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>State 1<strong></td>
                    <td>0.8</td>
                    <td>0.7</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>State 2<strong></td>
                    <td>0.2</td>
                    <td>0.3</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                I then solved for the steady states by setting the equation <strong>πP = π</strong> where π is the steady state vector and P is the transition matrix. I then solved for π by setting up the equation <strong>πP = π</strong> and solving for π. The steady state vector is [0.777, 0.223].
            </p>
            <p>
                We can easily calculate the expected number of high quality products by multiplying the steady state value 0.777 by 150, which gives us 117 high quality products.
            </p>

            <p>I've started on this cool project that involves using sentiment analysis to optimize portfolios. Should be really cool and fun and I'm really hoping to get it up and running asap</p>
            <p>I already got a python implementation but it's too easy and boring. I'm gonna implement the portfolio optimization algorithm from scratch and reuse the same python sentiment model for analysis.</p>

            <p>I've had a lot of time to think about the kind of person I am. I am surrounded by individuals who can accomplish so much with so little. I want to do that. It may have been the absurd desire to be one of the cracked kids in my grade, or the unending desire to retire early, but I want to achieve as much as I possibly can. Not necessarily in grades, but in pursuits that cannot be easily replicated.</p>
            <p>I've already finished my first project, and I've started doing the fundamental research for my second project (markov chains). I hope to get a few projects out by the time I reach second year and want a research position.</p>
