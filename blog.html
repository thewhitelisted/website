            <p>I've had a lot of time to think about the kind of person I am. I am surrounded by individuals who can accomplish so much with so little. I want to do that. It may have been the absurd desire to be one of the cracked kids in my grade, or the unending desire to retire early, but I want to achieve as much as I possibly can. Not necessarily in grades, but in pursuits that cannot be easily replicated.</p>
            <p>I've already finished my first project, and I've started doing the fundamental research for my second project (markov chains). I hope to get a few projects out by the time I reach second year and want a research position.</p>
