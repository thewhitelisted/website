        <h1>May 2025</h1>
        <h2>202505251229</h2>
        <p>I decided to take some time to assess myself in the past year and reevaluate the goals and priorities in my life. Looking back at the start of the year, I was focused on having fun. There's nothing wrong with that, but don't be upset if you don't improve or change. I realized that I want to change. I want to continuously get better and become the best at what I do.
          <br><br>
          <b>What is it that I want to do?</b>
          <br>
          I spent some time defining some goals for myself. Making things more defined for myself meant that I could actually start working towards them. I figured out what I want to do with my career. I figured out who I want to spend my time with. I figured out how I want to approach academics.
          <br><br>
          <b>What does it mean to be me?</b>
          <br>
          I am not anyone else, nor do I want to be anyone else. I am in a constant state of change. I do not wish to be the same person I was yesterday, nor do I wish to be the same person tomorrow. I am a mathematician, someone who uses math to explain the world. I am a thinker, someone who questions everything. I am a dreamer, someone who wishes for more than what he has, and aims to achieve it through hard work. 
          <br><br>
          <b>What will I do going into year 2?</b>
          <br>
          I am going to put a large focus on my academics, I wasn't the happiest with my grades this past year, and I want to change that. The side projects are going to go on hold for now.

        <p>I've started a new project (even though exams are literally starting tomorrow)! This one is more fintech focused but has an application to trading as it allows me to forward test my strategies in somewhat random conditions. I plan on implementing some momentum agents and eventually market makers. Right now there is a ton of liquidity in my system but it's mostly random behaviors so I plan on implementing various systems to simulate a steady increase in price over time, etc.</p>

        <p>Okay so I found this cool problem:</p>
        <img src="./markov_1.jpg" alt="Markov chain problem illustration" style="width: 400px; height:auto">
        <p>Here is how I solved it:</p>
        <p>
          This is a classic Markov chain problem where we have to find the state probabilities of the system. I mapped out the transition matrix as follows:
        </p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th></th>
              <th>State 1</th>
              <th>State 2</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>State 1</strong></td>
              <td>0.8</td>
              <td>0.7</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>State 2</strong></td>
              <td>0.2</td>
              <td>0.3</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
          I solved for the steady state vector <strong>π</strong> by setting up the equation <strong>πP = π</strong>. The resulting steady state is [0.777, 0.223]. Multiplying 0.777 by 150 gives 117 high quality products.

          I've started a cool project involving sentiment analysis to optimize portfolios. I plan to build a portfolio optimization algorithm from scratch and integrate it with my Python sentiment model.

          I’ve had some time to reflect on my goals. Surrounded by high achievers, I’m inspired to excel—not just academically, but in unique pursuits that can’t easily be replicated. I’ve completed my first project and am beginning research for my second project focused on Markov chains.
