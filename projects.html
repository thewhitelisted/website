        </p>
        <h3>100 Entries</h3>
        <p>a fictional journal chronicling a slow emotional descent into loneliness, longing, and psychological unraveling, told through 100 intimate daily reflections.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Interim</h3>
        <p>interim is a short story that explores themes of isolation, identity, and existential transition through the metaphor of a train journey and its silent passengers.</p>

        <h2>April 2025</h2>
        <h3>Agent-Based Market Simulator (In Development)</h3>
        <p>Designed and implemented a high-performance agent-based market simulator with a realistic limit order book engine to explore microstructure dynamics and agent interactions in financial markets.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Developed a full-featured simulation of a discrete-time order-driven market with support for limit, market, and cancel orders.</li>
          <li>Engineered autonomous trading agents (e.g., noise traders, liquidity takers) capable of placing strategic orders and reacting to market conditions.</li>
          <li>Optimized for clarity and modularity to support future extensions (e.g., market makers, reinforcement learning agents, adversarial strategies).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Financial Viscosity Indicator: A Physics Inspired Stability Metric</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Innovative Design:</b> Combines price displacement (distance from equilibrium) and velocity (rate of change) to proactively gauge market instability, drawing analogies from viscous fluid dynamics and spring systems.</li>
          <li><b>Empirical Promise:</b> Demonstrated responsiveness during major market disruptions (e.g., COVID-19 crash, 2022 bear market), suggesting potential as an early-warning tool for regime shifts.</li>
          <li><b>Work in Progress:</b> Highlights limitations (directional agnosticism, heuristic parameters) and outlines future steps (ML integration, first-principle derivation) to evolve into a robust risk-management tool.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Alpha Forecasting Using SHAP Feature Attribution</h3>
        <p>
          Developed a multi-class machine learning model using XGBoost to forecast 5-day return ranks for Nasdaq-100 stocks, leveraging engineered technical indicators as predictive features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interpreted model behavior with SHAP explainability tools, identifying key alpha drivers such as volatility, mean-reversion signals, and momentum z-scores.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simulated a weekly long-short Q5â€“Q1 portfolio strategy, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 0.57 and demonstrating statistically meaningful signal extraction from market data.

        <h3>Portfolio Optimization Using Sentiment Analysis in Rust</h3>
        <p>
          Sentiment-Driven Portfolio Adjustments: Integrates FinBERT sentiment analysis by scraping news from multiple sources. The results feed into the Black-Litterman model to adjust stock allocations in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Combines Modern Portfolio Theory with subjective market views for a balanced, risk-averse portfolio.

        <h3>Markov Chain-Based Market Regime Detection in Rust</h3>
        <p>
          Detects bull, bear, and sideways market regimes using hidden Markov models (HMM) and Viterbi algorithms.

        <h3>Risk Assessment in Financial Markets: Monte Carlo and Heston Model Simulations in Rust</h3>
        <p>
          A Rust implementation of Monte Carlo and Heston stochastic volatility models to simulate stock price paths and assess financial risk via Value at Risk (VaR). Utilizes async processing for efficiency and includes visualizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research was conducted in late February with coding and writeup completed in early March.
