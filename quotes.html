    here are some quotes that I find meaningful:
    <br />
    <br />
    “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the
    heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the
    eye.”
    <br />― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince
    <br />
    <br />
    “It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so
    important.”
    <br />― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince
    <br />
    <br />
    “Well, I must endure the presence of a few caterpillars if I wish to
    become acquainted with the butterflies.”
    <br />― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince
    <br />
    <br />
    “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought
    without accepting it.”
    <br />― Aristotle, Metaphysics
    <br />
    <br />
    “The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.”
    <br />― Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
    <br />
    <br />
    “When you arise in the morning think of what a privilege it is to be
    alive, to think, to enjoy, to love ...”
    <br />― Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

    I will add more when I remember them :)
