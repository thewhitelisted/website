    <p>
      here are some quotes that I find meaningful:
      <br />
      <br />
      “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the
      heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the
      eye.”
      <br />― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince
      <br />
      <br />
      “It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so
      important.”
      <br />― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince
      <br />
      <br />
      “Well, I must endure the presence of a few caterpillars if I wish to
      become acquainted with the butterflies.”
      <br />― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince
      <br />
      <br />
      “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought
      without accepting it.”
      <br />― Aristotle, Metaphysics
      <br />
      <br />
      “The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.”
      <br />― Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
      <br />
      <br />
      “When you arise in the morning think of what a privilege it is to be
      alive, to think, to enjoy, to love ...”
      <br />― Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

      I will add more when I remember them :)
